## Make It Work
### 1. Backend setup
From the project root:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -U pip
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary firebase-admin pydantic
```

Then run backend:

```powershell
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 2. Frontend setup
In a new terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Required config
- Keep `service-account.json` in project root for Firebase Admin verification.
- If needed, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to your backend URL.
